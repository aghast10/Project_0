# Python Learning Projects

Welcome! 👋

This repository contains my personal Python projects as part of my journey to learn and improve my programming skills. I'm currently teaching myself how to code, starting with Python, and these projects reflect my progress, experimentation, and growing understanding of the language.

## 🚀 Purpose

- **Practice & Learning**: Every line of code here is written by me as a way to apply what I'm learning.
- **No Direct AI Assistance in Code**: To ensure I truly develop the skills, I have not used AI tools to write or debug the code itself. All logic and implementation are done manually.
- **AI Used for README Only**: Since English is not my first language, I have used AI to help write and improve the clarity and presentation of this README and any other documentation. This helps make the project easier to understand for others while I focus on coding skills.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder or file in this repository represents a different exercise, challenge, or small project I’ve worked on. These are based on online tutorials, books, or ideas I’ve come up with on my own.

## 💡 Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of Python syntax and logic.
- Practice writing clean, readable, and functional code.
- Document my progress and growth over time.

## 🛠️ Disclaimer

These are beginner-level projects and are intended as personal learning tools. I welcome feedback, suggestions, or improvements from more experienced developers.

Thanks for visiting! 🙏
